# Square Fight using SDL and C++

### A little note on why I left OpenGL:
### I understand that OpenGL is just a graphics API but not a "graphics library". It's been fun learning OpenGL but i guess it's time to switch to SDL because how little time i have in these 3-4 months(Exams). I takes literally days or sometimes weeks to get some basic thing working. So SDL is going to be my last choice, there is no switch back. I promise one day i will make something in pure OpenGL.

Well the game is almost done. There is still some stuff to do like for example the collision detection, gravity and basic stuff related to the enemy. Also need
to fix the Text Rendering because it kinda sucks right now. Well probably on 15-05-2023 I will update this README and release the executables. Need to work on Windows build too. This game is obviously an shitty garbage but hey it's my first game (they suck a lot).

Well the game is kinda done. I am really not going to consider this a good game. This is just some basic mechanics copied from Mario tbh. But I am pretty sure if I want to make this a good game then it requires me to refactor almost the entire project. I am not really interested in that. Anyways I will hopefully make my next game a bit better than this garbage.

* Previous Game (OpenGL, not complete) - https://github.com/systemcoding/opengl-game

This is a complete game that's going to be made in SDL and C++. Not a 3D one but should be good for a starter like me.
