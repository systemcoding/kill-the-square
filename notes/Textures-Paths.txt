So this is my first note on this project. I am going to talk about textures and these paths.

This bugged for me about 2 days and i went to discord to find out that i set my paths wrong.
In VS Code for debugger what i've done is that in my launch.json file:

I set "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}" (Well this is wrong)
It should be -> "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/build"

And also i should talk about the order of rendering stuff onto the screen.

                        clearScreen()
                            |
                            V
                        displayScreen()
                            |
                            V
                        render()
                            |
                            V
                          other stuff...

Well this is wrong and the correct order is:

                        clearScreen()
                            |
                            V
                        render()
                            |
                            V
                        displayScreen()
                            |
                            V
                          other stuff...

This made my day even harder and luckily someone on discord found the problem (the order and paths). someone
yea atleast i was able to learn something now
